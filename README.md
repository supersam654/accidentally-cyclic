# DAGger

A CLI tool for creating internal dependency graphs of Node.js projects.

## Requirements

* Node.js with ES6 support (tested with Node 6)
* A modern web browser (tested with Firefox and Chrome)

## Quick Start

This will be revamped when I push this as an `npm` package.

    git clone https://github.com/supersam654/DAGger.git
    cd DAGger
    node index.js ../path/to/the/index/of/your/project

Then open `www/index.html` in your web browser.

## TODO

- [] Publish as an npm module.
- [] Make the CLI portion work.
- [] Make the frontend a bit less sketchy.
- [] Add screenshots.
- [] Add some test cases.
